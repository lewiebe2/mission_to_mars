# mission_to_mars
This repository holds the files to create a web app for Mars data using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape text, full-resolution images, and the titles of those images. The scraped data is then stored on a Mongo database, and a web application is used to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
